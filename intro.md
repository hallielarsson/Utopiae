# Maddie & Lara I #

## Chapter 1 ##
1. A: We do a crap job of tutorializing.
1. B: Tutoring you mean? Like teaching?
1. A: Yes, well ... not quite. But yes. Sortof? Hmm....
1. *45 seconds have elapsed.*
1. B: Waiting.
1. A: So, yes, I guess teaching? Teaching plus onboarding. Making tutorials.
1. B: Like in games?
1. A: Like in games.
1. B: We don't make games.
1. A: Not we like Lara and Maddie. We like Americans.
1. B: I'm Canadian by birth, thank you very much. Also, since when do we like Americans?
1. A: Boo. Anyway, Canada is still in North America.
1. B: ... and weren't you technically born in Sweden?
1. A: OK! we-english-speakers. we-agents-of-western-imperialism. whatever. You know what I mean.
1. B: That you're bad at teaching? Yeah, I'm picking up on that.
1. A: ðŸ’©ðŸ˜¡ðŸ’©
1. A: And if we're talking technical, my birth certificate TECHNICALLY lists my birthplace as "IN THE AIR".
1. A: So anyway. Our CULTURE is bad at giving new players a chance to play the game. 
1. *B is typing something...*
1. A: Lara, I swear if you are typing that society isn't a game I'm gonna block you for a month. 
1. B: My banter is adorable.
1. A: Your banter is totally adorable! But, #realtalk, it's been a shitty day of people not understanding what I talk about and I would really appreciate it if one of my best friends in the world were not another one of those people.
1. B: ðŸ™‡
1. A: ðŸ’• ðŸ’• ðŸ’• ðŸ’• ðŸ’• ðŸ’• ðŸ’• ðŸ’• 

## Chapter 2 ##
1. A: So. what's the last game you played that had a terrible tutorial?
1. B: Dunno. I don't play many games...
1. B: Ack. Sorry. Apparently I'm stil trying to get into supportive-listening-mode (your day was not the only one that was crappy, My Good Teen). Give me a second...
*30 seconds have elapsed.*
1.B: Alright. I have one. Two years ago, Steve got me to play Monster Hunter: Something. The game kept throwing up long explanations about things I didn't have enough context to understand. 
1. A: Yeah! Crap. Information overload without context.
1. B: I've got another one. Skyrim's makes you sit through slow expository dialog and then deeply gates your freedom until you jump through a bunch of hoops.
1. B: Sometimes literally. There's a jump in there that I had a lot of trouble making. I stopped played the game the first time because I gave up on that jump. 
1. B: Which would have been fine if the whole rest of the game was about making that jump, BUT IT JUST ISN'T. The rest of the game is all about doing whatever the heck you want the way you want to.
1. A: YES. Exactly. :smiley:
1. A: So, like. School. School is like that part of Skyrim. For a lot of people, the first time they learn about a thing it's totally great, assuming it's going at the right pace for them. 
1. A: But school, like that cutscene, is unskippable, whether or not you already know the skills you need to play the game that comes after.
1. A: PLUS: you totally get hung up on stuff that doesn't-hecking-matter, like that dumb jump. And they don't give you weapons until later on because, I guess it would let you interrupt the cutscene that isn't that good anyway?
1. A: PLUS PLUS: When Sophie played it she couldn't even get past the first two minutes cause it made her want to vomit. She can't play first person games. School does the same thing to people that don't fit the assumptions about what is easy / hard / impossible for a 'typical' student.
1. A: +++: Even outside school, culture punishes the kinds of failure that lead to learning and better people, and protects kids from the kinds of experiences that let them learn how to be good people.
1. B: Nod. Classes not going so well then? :smiley: #supportivesmile

## Chapter 3 ##
B: Hmmm. What can I do to help?
A: I donno, help me flesh out my ideas? What doesn't make sense?
B: Well ... I get what you mean by a bad tutorial. But I'm not sure what a good one looks like?
